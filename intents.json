I am currently enrolled at KTH Royal Instute of Tecnology as entry university and will attend University of Twente as exit university where I will specialize in Data Science for persona information. I am expected to graduate in summer 2022. As a Data Scientist, my goal is to turn data into actionable insights applicable for customers' benefits and improved experience. I believe data can be used to have a real impact on people's daily lives. When I am not wondering on a new way to apply some data, I love practicing sports to keep myself healthy, enjoying time with my peers and meeting new people from all around the worlds."],
